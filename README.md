# DbipUtil

DbipUtil includes DB-IP Lite databases and a simple interface to them, based on `maxmind-db` gem.

The included databases are refreshed automatically. A GitHub Actions workflow runs `bin/dbiputil-refresh` and then `rake release` at **00:00&nbsp;GMT on the 2nd of every month** to publish a new gem version. Ensure to comply with the database licensing terms below in this document.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

```bash
bundle add dbip_util
```

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

```bash
gem install dbip_util
```

## Usage

```ruby
record = DbipUtil::Country.get("1.1.1.1")
if record.nil?
  puts '1.1.1.1 was not found in the database'
else
  puts record['country']['iso_code']
  puts record['country']['names']['en']
end

# Also: DbipUtil::ASN, DbipUtil::City
```

This gem uses a `maxmind-db` gem. More documentation is provided by said gem: https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/maxmind-db

The databases are documented here:

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. If you need to trigger a release manually, run `bin/dbiputil-refresh` and then `bundle exec rake release`. This will create a git tag for the version, push commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
